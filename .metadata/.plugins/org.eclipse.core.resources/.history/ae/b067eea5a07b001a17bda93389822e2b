12. Graph Algorithm Validity
	The graph problem was checking that every room can be accessed from another room, and 
	depth first search is an optimal way to find this

15. Checking Adjacent Difficulties
	The graph problem was checking that difficult rooms are only next to easy rooms and that
	easy rooms are only next to difficult rooms. This can be done similarly to how signed
	graphs work, but instead of each node being positive or negative, they are either 
	easy or hard

17. Visualize Objectives

19. Visualize Routes

20. Calculate Runtime

22. Dungeon MST

23. Kruskal's Algorithm
