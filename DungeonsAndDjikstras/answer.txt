7. Determine Vertex Property
	In 5 and 6, you're working with the number of connections (edges) that each vertex has.

10. Visualize Dungeon

12. Graph Algorithm Validity
	The graph problem was checking that every room can be accessed from another room, and 
	depth first search is an optimal way to find this

13. Dungeon Difficulty

15. Checking Adjacent Difficulties
	The graph problem was checking that difficult rooms are only next to easy rooms and that
	easy rooms are only next to difficult rooms. This can be done similarly to how signed
	graphs work, but instead of each node being positive or negative, they are either 
	easy or hard

17. Visualize Objectives

19. Visualize Routes
	Did not get dijkstra's working :(

20. Calculate Runtime
	Seeing as the runtime of dijkstra's algorithm is O(E + V Log(V)), we can substitute in Connections C as Edges E,
	and Rooms R as Vertices V, and multiply by the number of times the algorithm must be run, or the number of 
	Objectives B. Therefore the runtime is O(B * (C + R Log(R))

22. Dungeon MST

23. Kruskal's Algorithm

25. Visualize Clusters
